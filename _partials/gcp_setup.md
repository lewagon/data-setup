### Configure the Google Cloud CLI

- Authenticate the `gcloud` CLI with the google account you used for GCP

  ```bash
  gcloud auth login
  ```

- Login to your Google account on the new tab opened in your web browser

- List your active account and check your email address you used for GCP is present

  ```bash
  gcloud auth list
  ```

- Set your current project (replace `PROJECT_ID` with the `ID` of your project, e.g. `wagon-bootcamp-123456`)

  ```bash
  gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
  ```

- List your active account and current project and check your project is present

  ```bash
  gcloud config list
  ```

- Now let's set up Application Default Credentials so your Python code can access GCP:

  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```

  This will open a browser window. Log in with the same Google account you used to create your GCP project. Your credentials will be saved automatically.

- Let's verify your Application Default Credentials are working:

  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
  ```

  You should see a long token string. If you see an error, run `gcloud auth application-default login` again.
