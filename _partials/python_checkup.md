## Python setup check

### Python and packages check

Let's reset your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/code && exec zsh
```

Check your Python version with the following commands:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL <PYTHON_CHECKER_URL>)" <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

Run the following command to check if you successfully installed the required packages:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL <PIP_CHECKER_URL>)"
```

Now run the following command to check if you can load these packages:
```bash
python -c "$(curl -fsSL <PIP_LOADER_URL>)"
```

### Jupyter check

Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser should open on a `jupyter` window:

Click on `New` and in the dropdown menu select `Python 3 (ipykernel)`:

A tab should open on a new notebook:

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run:
``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

It should output `<PYTHON_VERSION>` followed by some more details. If not, check with a TA.

You can close your web browser then terminate the jupyter server with `CTRL` + `C`.

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.
