## Python setup check

Let's reset your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/code && exec zsh
```

Check your Python version with the following commands:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL {{ PYTHON_CHECKER_URL }})" {{ PYTHON_VERSION }}
```

Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser should open on a `jupyter` window.

  <summary>Note if you're running the setup on a virtual machine</summary>

  VSCode detects that a jupyter notebook started in your virtual machine and creates a port forward in order to allow you to open the application in your browser.

  Hit Open in Browser or go to http://localhost:8888/ (the url to use is available in the terminal).

  On the first run, jupyter will ask for the token displayed in the terminal of your virtual machine in order to allow you to connect to the application from your local machine.

  Fill the token and hit Log in.

  You are now interacting from your local machine with the jupyter application running in your virtual machine.

Click on `New` and in the dropdown menu select `Python 3 (ipykernel)`:

A tab should open on a new notebook:

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run:

``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

It should output `{{ PYTHON_VERSION }}` followed by some more details. If not, check with a TA.

In another cell, run:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.__version___
```

This might take a few minutes to run. It should output a version number, `2.2.3`.  If not, check with a TA.

You can close your web browser then terminate the jupyter server with `CTRL` + `C`.

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.
