## Google Cloud Platform setup

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is a cloud solution that you are going to use in order to deploy your Machine Learning-based products to production.

🚨 If you are a student of the **Part-Time Bootcamp or the Flex bootcamp**, SKIP THIS SECTION FOR NOW! **Google Cloud** offers $300 worth of free credits for a duration of 3 months. You do not want to activate your Google Cloud account too soon 🙅‍♂️

### Project setup

- Go to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create an account if you do not already have one
- In the Cloud Console, on the project list, select or create a Cloud project

⚠️ **Important:** When creating a new project, you will see an **Organization** field. Leave this set to **"No organization"**. Do not select or create an organization. Choosing an organization applies restrictions that can prevent you from using Google Cloud services during the bootcamp.

- Give it a name such as `Wagon Bootcamp` for example
- Notice the `ID` automatically created for the project, e.g. `wagon-bootcamp-123456`

ℹ️ Note the **Project ID** (e.g. `wagon-bootcamp-123456`) this is **not** the same as the project name you chose (e.g. `Wagon Bootcamp`). You will need the ID later when running terminal commands, but don't worry, you can always find it in Google Cloud.

### Account language

In order to facilitate the following of the instructions during the bootcamp, open your Google Cloud account preferences:

[https://myaccount.google.com/language](https://myaccount.google.com/language)

If the *preferred language* is not:

- **English**
- **United States**

Then switch the language to english:

- Click on the edit pen logo
- Select **English**
- Select **United States**
- Click on **Select**

### Billing account

You will now link your account to your credit card. This step is required or you will not be able to use the services provided by Google Cloud. Do not worry, you will be able to consume most Google Cloud services through free credits throughout the bootcamp.

⚠️ In some cases, Google may charge your card (around €10) to verify that it is valid. This will unfortunately not be refunded once you are approved, but will be added as credit in Google Cloud that you can use once your free credits have been used or expired.

- Click on **Billing**

- Click on **ADD BILLING ACCOUNT**
- Give a name to your billing account, e.g. `My Billing Account`
- Click on "I have read..." and agree the to the terms of service
- Click on **CONTINUE**
- Select your account type: `Individual`
- Fill your name and address

You should see that you have a free credit of "$300 credits over the next 90days".

- Click on card details
- Enter your credit card info
- Click on **START MY FREE TRIAL**

Once this is done, verify that your billing account is linked to your Google Cloud project.

- Select your project
- Go to **Billing**
- Select **LINK A BILLING ACCOUNT**
- Select `My Billing Account`
- Click on **SET ACCOUNT**

You should now see:

```bash
Free trial status: $300 credit and 91 days remaining - with a full account, you'll get unlimited access to all of Google Cloud Platform.
```

  <summary>👉 If you do not own a credit card 👈</summary>

If you do not own a credit card, an alternative is to setup a **Revolut** account.
Revolut is a financial app that will allow you to create a virtual credit card linked to your mobile phone billing account.

Skip this step if you own a credit card and use your credit card for the setup.

Download the Revolut app, or go to [revolut](https://www.revolut.com/a-radically-better-account) and follow the steps to download the app (enter your mobile phone number and click on Get Started).

- Open the Revolut app
- Enter your mobile phone number
- Enter the verification code received by SMS
- The app will ask for your country, address, first and last name, date of birth, email address
- The app will also ask for a selfie and request your profession
- The app will require a photo of your identification card or passport

Once this is done, select the standard (free) plan. No need to add the card to Apple pay, or ask for a the delivery of a physical card, or add money securely.

You now have a virtual card which we will use for the Google Cloud setup.

In the main view of the Revolut app

- Click on Ready to use
- Click on the card
- Click on Show card details
- Note down the references of the virtual credit card and use them in order to proceed with the Google Cloud setup

<details>
  <summary>👉 If you receive an email from Google saying "Urgent: your billing account XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX has been suspended" 👈</summary>

This may happen especially in case you just setup a Revolut account.

- Click on PROCEED TO VERIFICATION
- You will be asked to send a picture of your credit card (only the last 4 digits, no other info)
- In case you used **Revolut**, you can send a screenshot of your virtual credit card (do not forget to remove the validity date from the screenshot)
- Explain that you are attending the Le Wagon bootcamp, do not own a credit card, and have just created a Revolut account in order to setup Google Cloud for the bootcamp using a virtual credit card

You may receive a validation or requests for more information within 30 minutes.

Once the verification goes through, you should receive an email stating that "Your Google Cloud Platform billing account XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX has been fully reinstated and is ready to use.".

### Enabling Google Cloud services

- Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project

ℹ️ You have a **$300 credit** to use for Google Cloud resources, which will be more than enough for the bootcamp.

- [Enable the BigQuery and Compute Engine APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery,compute) (This step may take a few minutes)

That's it for the browser setup! Terminal setup comes later in this guide.
