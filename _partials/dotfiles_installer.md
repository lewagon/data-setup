### Run the dotfiles installer

It's time to run the `dotfiles` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email.
:warning: You **need** to put one of the emails listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress. ðŸ’¡ Select the `@users.noreply.github.com` address if you don't want your email to appear in public repositories you may contribute to.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
