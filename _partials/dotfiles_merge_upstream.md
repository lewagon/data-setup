Open your terminal and go to your `dotfiles` project:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
```

Time to merge the changes from `lewagon/dotfiles` into yours:
1. Commit your current version of your dotfiles:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git status # Check what will be committed
   git commit -m "Version prior to new setup"
   ```

1. Let's bring in the changes from upstream: `git merge upstream/master`

1. Check that you're not in `MERGING` state. If you are, resolve any conflicts.

1. Do a `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` to check what changed.

1. If nothing seems out of the ordinary, continue

  Let's just take over the current version from `lewagon/dotfiles`.

  First abort the merge: `git merge --abort`.

  Run `<CODE_EDITOR_CMD> .`

  In <CODE_EDITOR>, open the `zshrc` file. Replace its content with the [newest version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/dotfiles/master/zshrc). Save to disk.

  Still in <CODE_EDITOR>, open the `zprofile` file. Replace its content with the [newest version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/dotfiles/master/zprofile). Save to disk.

  Back in the terminal, run a `git diff` and check if this didn't remove any personal configuration setting that you wanted to keep.

Time to commit your changes and push them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update for Data Science bootcamp"
git push origin master
```
