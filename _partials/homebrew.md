## Homebrew

On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) which is a Package Manager.
It will be used as soon as we need to install some software.
To do so, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your **macOS user account password** (the one you use to [log in](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202860) when you reboot your Macbook).
:warning: When typing a password in the Terminal, you will **not** get a visual feedback (something like `*****`), this is **normal**!! Type the password and confirm by typing `Enter`.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

  <summary>👉 If you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error 👈</summary>

Just run this:

``` bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

<details>
  <summary>👉 If you get a `Error: Not a valid ref: refs/remotes/origin/master` error 👈</summary>


The full error would be:

``` bash
Error: Not a valid ref: refs/remotes/origin/master :
fatal: ambiguous argument 'refs/remotes/origin/master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
```

Run the following commands to solve it:

``` bash
rm -fr $(brew --repo homebrew/core)  # because you can't `brew untap homebrew/core`
brew tap homebrew/core
```

</details>

Proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew upgrade git         || brew install git
brew upgrade gh          || brew install gh
brew upgrade wget        || brew install wget
brew upgrade imagemagick || brew install imagemagick
brew upgrade jq          || brew install jq
brew upgrade openssl     || brew install openssl
brew upgrade tree        || brew install tree
brew upgrade ncdu        || brew install ncdu
brew upgrade xz          || brew install xz
brew upgrade readline    || brew install readline
```
