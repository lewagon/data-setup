## Docker 🐋

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

_if you already have Docker installed on your machine please update with the latest version_

### Install Docker

Go to [Docker install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

Then follow the tutorial instructions to install Docker **using the repository**. There are 2 steps:

1. Set up Docker's apt repository.
2. Install the Docker packages.

Now, let's make sure we can run `docker` without `sudo`.

Run the following commands one by one:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
sudo rm -rf ~/.docker/
```

When finished, run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

The following message should print:
