## (Bonus) Kata

If you are done with your setup, please ask around if some classmates need some help with theirs (macOS, Linux, Windows). We will have our first lectures at 2pm and will talk about the Setup you just did + onboard you on Kitt.

If you don't have a lot of experience with `git` and GitHub, please [(re-)watch this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY) (`1.25` playback speed is fine).

If you do, then you can wait for the first lecture working on this [Tic-Tac-Toe Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b817c2a0ce070ace8002be0/train/python)
