        <strong>I already attended a Le Wagon coding bootcamp (Web Development or Data Science & AI) <em>but I have a new laptop</em></strong>

This means that you already forked the GitHub repo `lewagon/dotfiles`, but at that time the configuration was maybe not ready for the current Data Science & AI bootcamp. Let's update it. **Ask a TA to join you for the nex steps.**

First, clone your fork on this machine:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo clone $GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
```
