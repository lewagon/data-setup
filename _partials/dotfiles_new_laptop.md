Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

You should see your GitHub username printed. If it's not the case, **stop here** and ask for help.
There seems to be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your laptop:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

Now, your dotfiles might not be in sync anymore with the Le Wagon version. **Ask a TA** to run through these steps together:

1. `git merge upstream/master`
2. Check that you're not in MERGING state (if any conflicts resolve them)
3. Do a `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` to check what changed
4. If nothing seems out of the ordinary, continue

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one
at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email.
:warning: You **need** to put one of the emails listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress. 💡 Select the `@users.noreply.github.com` address if you don't want your email to appear in public repositories you may contribute to.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
