### Install pre-requisites

Before installing Python, please check your `xz` version with:

```bash
brew info xz
```

It should be more than `5.2.0`, **if not** you should run:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/opt/xz
brew upgrade
brew install xz
```

Then run:

```bash
brew install readline
```

### Install `pyenv`

macOS comes with an outdated version of Python that we don't want to use. You might already have installed Anaconda or something else to tinker with Python and Data Science packages. All of this does not really matter as we are going to do a professional setup of Python where you'll be able to switch which version you want to use whenever you type `python` in the terminal.

First let's install `pyenv` with the following Terminal command:

```bash
brew install pyenv
exec zsh
```

### Install Python

Let's install the [latest stable version of Python](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) supported by Le Wagon's curriculum:

```bash
pyenv install <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

This command might take a while, this is perfectly normal. Don't hesitate to help other students seated next to you!

  <summary>🛠 Troubleshooting `pyenv` not found</summary>

If you encounter an error `Command 'pyenv' not found`: execute the following line:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile
```

Then try to install Python again:

```bash
pyenv install <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

If `pyenv` is still not found, contact a teacher.

  <summary>🛠 Troubleshooting `zlib`</summary>

If you encounter an error installing Python with `pyenv` about `zlib`:

```txt
zipimport.ZipImportError: can't decompress data; zlib not available
```

Install `zlib` with:

```bash
brew install zlib
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include"
```

Then try to install Python again:

```bash
pyenv install <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

It could raise another error about `bzip2`, you can ignore it and continue to the next step.

OK once this command is complete, we are going to tell the system to use this version of Python **by default**. This is done with:

```bash
pyenv global <PYTHON_VERSION>
exec zsh
```

To check if this worked, run `python --version`. If you see `<PYTHON_VERSION>`, perfect! If not, ask a TA that will help you debug the problem thanks to `pyenv versions` and `type -a python` (`python` should be using the `.pyenv/shims` version first).
