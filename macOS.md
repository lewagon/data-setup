# Setup instructions

The following instructions will help you to get ready for [Le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.com) Data Bootcamp:

- Install Python via Anaconda (a distribution for the Data Scientist)
- Install a text editor, where you'll spend your day and nights
- Setup your terminal
- Setup git and GitHub


## Command Line Tools

Open the Terminal (click the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen and type `Terminal`):

![](images/open-terminal.png)

Copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit Enter.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you'll receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software. Accept and wait. If it fails, try again the command line above, sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

![](images/xcode-select-install.png)

While it's downloading, you can go on with configuring your GitHub account, but **stop** before Homebrew. You'll need the command line tools installed for that step.


## GitHub account

Have you signed up to GitHub? If not, [do it right away](https://github.com/join).

:point_right: **[Upload a picture](https://github.com/settings/profile)** and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is important as we'll use an internal dashboard with your avatars. Please do it **now**.


## Homebrew

On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) which is a Package Manager.
It will be used as soon as we need to install some software.
To do so, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your laptop session password.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

:warning: **ONLY IF** you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error, just run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

Error message or not, proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew install git
brew upgrade git
```


## Sublime Text 3 - Your text editor

A text editor is one of the most important tools of a developer. Go to [this page](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download **Sublime Text 3** for OS X. Install it (double click the downloaded file and drag & drop the app **into** the `Applications` folder, **don't skip this**). If you had Sublime Text 2 installed before, please uninstall it (by dragging/dropping it to the Trash).

Sublime Text is free without any time limitation but a popup will appear every ten saves to remind you there is a license to buy. You can hit `Esc` when this happens, but feel free to buy Sublime Text if you really like this one (there are alternatives).

Again, make sure that Sublime Text is there, not in the disk image you downloaded. To make sure it's correct, once Sublime Text is installed, unmount the "Sublime Text 3" disk in the left panel of Finder. Finder will complain if something went wrong. Ask a teacher.



## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Be careful, at the end of this script, it will prompt for your laptop password again. You have to write it correctly (you will not see it when you type) and hit `Enter`. You should get something like:

```bash
         __                                     __
  ____  / /_     ____ ___  __  __   ____  _____/ /_
 / __ \/ __ \   / __ `__ \/ / / /  /_  / / ___/ __ \
/ /_/ / / / /  / / / / / / /_/ /    / /_(__  ) / / /
\____/_/ /_/  /_/ /_/ /_/\__, /    /___/____/_/ /_/
                        /____/                       ....is now installed!
````

Now quit the Terminal (`⌘` + `Q`), and restart it.

You should see something like this:

![](images/on-my-zsh.png)

If not, **stop right away** and call a teacher.

On Mac, open `Terminal > Preferences` and set the "Pro" theme as default in `Profiles` (*`Réglages`* in French).

![](images/terminal-pro.png)

Quit and relaunch the Terminal. It should now have a nice black background, more easy on the eyes.


## GitHub

We need to generate SSH keys which are going to be used by GitHub and Heroku
to authenticate you. Think of it as a way to log in, but different from the
well known username/password couple. If you already generated keys
that you already use with other services, you can skip this step.

Open a terminal and type this, replacing the email with **yours** (the
same one you used to create your GitHub account). It will prompt
for information. Just press enter until it asks for a **passphrase**.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com"
```

**NB:** when asked for a passphrase, put something you want (and that you'll remember),
it's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. You'll type,
nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. Just type the passphrase,
and when you're done, press `Enter`.

Then you need to give your **public** key to GitHub. Run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

It will prompt on the screen the content of the `id_ed25519.pub` file. Copy that text,
then go to [github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh). Click on
**Add SSH key**, fill in the Title with your computer name, and paste the **Key**.
Finish by clicking on the **Add key** green button.

To check that this step is completed, in the terminal run this. You will be
prompted a warning, type `yes` then `Enter`.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you see something like this, you're done!

```bash
# Hi --------! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
```

If it does not work, try running this before trying again the `ssh -T` command:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Don't be in a rush, take time to [read this article](http://sebastien.saunier.me/blog/2015/05/10/github-public-key-authentication.html) to get a better
understanding of what those keys are used for.


## Anaconda

Time to install Python through the Anaconda distribution. Go to their [Product page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), select **macOS** and click on the Python 3 64-bit Graphical Installer (600+ MB).

Once downloaded, launch the installer and wait until it is complete.

Quit all your opened terminal window and open a new one. First check that `pip` is in Anaconda with:

```bash
type -a pip
```

If not, ask a TA. Otherwise, you can run:

```python
pip install pytest pylint ipdb
```


## Dotfiles (Standard configuration)

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration provided by [Le Wagon](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles), stored on GitHub. As your configuration is personal, you need your own repository storing it, so you first need to fork it to your GitHub account.

:arrow_right: [Click here to **fork**](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/fork) the `lewagon/dotfiles` repository to your account. Forking means that it will create a new repo in your GitHub account, identical to the original one. You'll have a new repository on your GitHub account, `your_github_username/dotfiles`. We need to fork because each of you will need to put specific information (e.g. your name) in those files.

Open your terminal. **Don't blindly copy paste this line**, replace `replace_this_with_your_github_username` with *your*
own github usernickname.

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=replace_this_with_your_github_username

# Example:
#   export GITHUB_USERNAME=ssaunier
```

Now copy/paste this very long line in your terminal. Do **not** change this one.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_ && git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh install.sh
```

Then run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`Firstname Lastname`) and your email.

Be careful, you **need** to put the **same** email as the one you sign up with on GitHub.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.

### Sublime Text auto-configuration

Open a new terminal and type this:

```bash
stt
```

It will **open Sublime Text in the context of your current folder**. That's how we'll use it.

**Close Sublime text** and open it again:

```bash
stt
```

**Wait 1 minute** for additional packages to be automatically installed (New tabs with text will automatically open, containing documentation for each new package installed). TO follow package installation, you can go to `View > Show console`.

To check if plugins are installed, open the Command Palette (`⌘` + `⇧` + `P` on OSX, `Ctrl` + `⇧` + `P` on Linux), type in `Packlist` and then `Enter`, you should see a couple of packages installed (like [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)).

If you don't, please install all of them manually. The list is referenced [here](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/blob/master/Package%20Control.sublime-settings).

When it's done, you can close Sublime Text.


### SSH Passphrase

In a terminal window, launch this command:

```bash
sw_vers
```

If your OS version (`ProductVersion` line) is greater or equal than **10.12**, you may proceed with the rest of this section. :warning: Otherwise, skip it and go directly to the Ruby install.

In order not to re-type your SSH passphrase at every `git push`, you can add these lines to the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config  # Creates the file if it does not exist
st ~/.ssh/config     # Opens the file in Sublime text
```

And then add these 3 lines to the file. **Save**.

```bash
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
```


# Alumni

Register as a Wagon alumni by going to [kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding](http://kitt.lewagon.com/onboarding). Select your batch, sign in with GitHub and enter all your information.

Your teacher will then validate that you are indeed part of the batch. You can ask him to do it as soon as you completed the registration form.

Once the teacher has approved your profile, go to your email inbox. You should have 2 emails:

- One from Slack, inviting you to the Le Wagon Alumni slack community (where you'll chat with your buddies and all the previous alumni). Click on **Join** and fill the information.
- One from GitHub, inviting you to `lewagon` team. **Accept it** otherwise you won't be able to access the lecture slides.
