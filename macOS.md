# Setup instructions

You will find below the instructions to set up you computer for Le Wagon Assessment

Please **read them carefully and execute all commands in the following order**. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask a teacher for help :raising_hand:


## GitHub account

Have you signed up to GitHub? If not, [do it right away](https://github.com/join).

:point_right: **[Upload a picture](https://github.com/settings/profile)** and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is important as we'll use an internal dashboard with your avatar. Please do this **now**, before you continue with this guide.

![GitHub picture](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/github_picture.png)


## Apple Silicon Chips

If you bought your computer after late 2020, chances are it has a new Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor: let's find out.

Open a new terminal window from Applications > Utilities or search for it with [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204014):

![Open Terminal on macOS](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/macos_open_terminal.png)

Copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit `Enter` to execute.

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/utils/macos_list_processor_type.sh)"
```

☝️ The result of the command should indicate whether your computer uses Apple Silicon.

If your computer uses Apple Silicon, expand the paragraph below and go through it. Otherwise ignore it.

<details>
  <summary>👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup for Apple Silicon 👈</summary>

### Uninstall Homebrew

We need to uninstall Homebrew in case a native version was installed.

Execute the following command in the terminal:

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

If brew was not installed you will get the message `brew: command not found!`

### Configure Terminal for Rosetta

Open the Finder app (or search for it with [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204014)).

Go to Applications > Utilities.

Duplicate the terminal app (select it, then `Cmd` + `C`, `Cmd` + `V`), and rename a copy as Terminal Rosetta.

Press `Cmd` + `I` on the Terminal Rosetta app, then check the box "Open using Rosetta".

⚠️ From now on during the bootcamp, whenever you are asked to open a Terminal, you will use the **Terminal Rosetta** app.

</details>


## A note about quitting apps on a Mac

Clicking the little red cross in the top left corner of the application window on a Mac **does not really quit it**, it just closes an active window. To quit the application _for real_ either press `Cmd + Q` when the application is active, or navigate to `APP_NAME` -> `Quit` in the menu bar.

![Quit Terminal on macOS](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/macos_quit.png)

During this setup you will be asked to **quit and re-open** applications multiple times, please make sure you do it properly :pray:

## Command Line Tools

Open a new terminal, copy-paste the following command and hit `Enter`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```bash
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software: click on "Install" and wait.


![Install xcode-select on macOS](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/macos_xcode_select_install.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the message "The software was installed" then all good :+1:

:x: If the command `xcode-select --install` fails try again: sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

:x: If you see the message "Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server", you need to update the software update catalog:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog
```

Once this is done, you can try to install again.


## Homebrew
### 1. Install:
On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) which is a Package Manager.
It will be used as soon as we need to install some software.
To do so, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your **macOS user account password** (the one you use to [log in](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202860) when you reboot your Macbook).
:warning: When typing a password in the Terminal, you will **not** get a visual feedback (something like `*****`), this is **normal**!! Type the password and confirm by typing `Enter`.

<details>
  <summary>🛠 If you get a <code>Error: Not a valid ref: refs/remotes/origin/master</code> error</summary>


The full error would be:

``` bash
Error: Not a valid ref: refs/remotes/origin/master :
fatal: ambiguous argument 'refs/remotes/origin/master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
```

Run the following commands to solve it:

``` bash
rm -fr $(brew --repo homebrew/core)  # because you can't `brew untap homebrew/core`
brew tap homebrew/core
```

</details>

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

### 2. Make sure you are on the latest version:

```bash
brew update
```

<details>
  <summary>🛠 If you get a <code>/usr/local must be writable</code> error</summary>

Just run this:

``` bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

</details>

### 3. Then install some useful software:

Proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew upgrade git         || brew install git
brew upgrade gh          || brew install gh
brew upgrade wget        || brew install wget
brew upgrade imagemagick || brew install imagemagick
brew upgrade jq          || brew install jq
brew upgrade openssl     || brew install openssl
brew upgrade tree        || brew install tree
brew upgrade ncdu        || brew install ncdu
brew upgrade xz          || brew install xz
brew upgrade readline    || brew install readline
```


## Chrome - your browser

Install the Google Chrome browser if you haven't got it already and set it as a __default browser__.

Follow the steps for your system from this link :point_right: [Install Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB)

__Why Chrome?__

We recommend to use it as your default browser as it's most compatible with testing or running your code, as well as working with Google Cloud Platform. Another alternative is Firefox, however we don't recommend using other tools like Opera, Internet Explorer or Safari.


## Visual Studio Code

### Installation

Let's install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) text editor.

Copy (`Cmd` + `C`) the command below then paste it in your terminal (`Cmd` + `V`):

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Then launch VS Code by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
code
```

:heavy_check_mark: If a VS Code window has just opened, you're good to go :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **contact a teacher**


## VS Code Extensions

### Installation

Let's install some useful extensions to VS Code.

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings
code --install-extension emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons
code --install-extension MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension KevinRose.vsc-python-indent
code --install-extension ms-python.vscode-pylance
code --install-extension ms-toolsai.jupyter
```

Here is a list of the extensions you are installing:
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)
- [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)

- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)


### Live Share configuration

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is a VS Code extension which allows you to share the code in your text editor for debugging and pair-programming: let's set it up!

Launch VS Code from your terminal by typing `code` and pressing `Enter`.

Click on the little arrow at the bottom of the left bar :point_down:

![VS Code Live Share](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/vscode_live_share.png)

- Click on the "Share" button, then on "GitHub (Sign in using GitHub account)".
- A popup appears asking you to sign in with GitHub: click on "Allow".
- You are redirected to a GitHub page in you browser asking you to authorize Visual Studio Code: click on "Continue" then "Authorize github".
- VS Code may display additional pop-ups: close them by clicking "OK".

That's it, you're good to go!


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/oh_my_zsh.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **ask for a teacher**


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Dotfiles

There are three options, choose **one**:

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>I already attended Web Development (FullStack) bootcamp at Le Wagon <em>on the same laptop</em></strong>
    </summary>

This means that you already forked the GitHub repo `lewagon/dotfiles`, but at that time the configuration was maybe not ready for the new Data Science bootcamp.

Open your terminal and go to your `dotfiles` project:

```bash
cd ~/code/<YOUR_GITHUB_NICKNAME>/dotfiles
code . # Open it in VS Code
```

In VS Code, open the `zshrc` file. Replace its content with the [newest version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/dotfiles/master/zshrc) of that file that we provide. Save to disk.

Back to the terminal, run a `git diff` and ask a TA to come and check about this configuration change. You should see stuff about Python and `pyenv`.

Once this is good, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add zshrc
git commit -m "Update zshrc for Data Science bootcamp"
git push origin master
```

</details>

OR


<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>I did not attend the Web Dev bootcamp at Le Wagon</strong>
    </summary>

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration provided by [Le Wagon](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles), stored on GitHub. As your configuration is personal, you need your own repository storing it, so you first need to fork it to your GitHub account.

:arrow_right: [Click here to **fork**](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/fork) the `lewagon/dotfiles` repository to your account (you'll need to click again on your picture to confirm _where_ you do the fork).

Forking means that it will create a new repo in your GitHub account, identical to the original one. You'll have a new repository on your GitHub account, `your_github_username/dotfiles`. We need to fork because each of you will need to put specific information (e.g. your name) in those
files.


Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

You should see your GitHub username printed. If it's not the case, **stop here** and ask for help.
There seems to be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your laptop:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one
at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email. Be careful
you **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you
don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
</details>


OR

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>I already attended Web Development (FullStack) bootcamp at Le Wagon <em>but I have a new laptop</em></strong>
    </summary>


Open your terminal and run the following command:

echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

you **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you
don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
</details>


## Installing Python (with [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

Before installing Python, please check your `xz` version with:

```bash
brew info xz
```

It should be more than `5.2.0`, **if not** you should run:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/opt/xz
brew upgrade
brew install xz
```

Then run:

```bash
brew install readline
```

macOS comes with an outdated version of Python that we don't want to use. You might already have installed Anaconda or something else to tinker with Python and Data Science packages. All of this does not really matter as we are going to do a professional setup of Python where you'll be able to switch which version you want to use whenever you type `python` in the terminal.

First let's install `pyenv` with the following Terminal command:

```bash
brew install pyenv
exec zsh
```

Let's install the [latest stable version of Python](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) supported by Le Wagon's curriculum:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.12
```

This command might take a while, this is perfectly normal. Don't hesitate to help other students seated next to you!

<details>
  <summary>🛠 Troubleshooting</summary>

If you encounter an error installing Python with `pyenv` about `zlib`:

```txt
zipimport.ZipImportError: can't decompress data; zlib not available
```

Install `zlib` with:

```bash
brew install zlib
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include"
```

Then try to install Python again:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.12
```

It could raise another error about `bzip2`, you can ignore it and continue to the next step.

</details>
<br>

OK once this command is complete, we are going to tell the system to use this version of Python **by default**. This is done with:

```bash
pyenv global 3.8.12
exec zsh
```

To check if this worked, run `python --version`. If you see `3.8.12`, perfect! If not, ask a TA that will help you debug the problem thanks to `pyenv versions` and `type -a python` (`python` should be using the `.pyenv/shims` version first).


## Python Virtual Environment

Before we start installing relevant Python packages, we will isolate the setup for the Bootcamp into a **dedicated** virtual environment. We will use a `pyenv` plugin called [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

First let's install this plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
exec zsh
```

Let's create the virtual environment we are going to use during the whole bootcamp:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 lewagon
```

Let's now set the virtual environment with:

```bash
pyenv global lewagon
```

Great! Anytime we'll install Python package, we'll do it in that environment.


## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `lewagon` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages in it.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). In the latest terminal where the virtualenv `lewagon` is activated, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then let's install some packages for the first weeks of the program:

If your computer uses **Apple Silicon**, expand the paragraph below and go through it. Otherwise ignore it.

<details>
  <summary>👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup for Apple Silicon 👈</summary>

``` bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/specs/releases/apple_silicon.txt
```
</details>

If your computer uses **Apple Intel**, expand the paragraph below and go through it. Otherwise ignore it.

<details>
  <summary>👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup for Apple Intel 👈</summary>

``` bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/specs/releases/apple_intel.txt
```
</details>


## `jupyter` notebook extensions

Pimp your `jupyter` notebooks with awesome extensions:

```bash
# install nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main
jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main
jupyter nbextension enable code_prettify/code_prettify
```

### Custom CSS

Improve the display of the [`details` disclosure elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) in your notebooks.

Open `custom/custom.css` in the config directory:
```bash
cd $(jupyter --config-dir)
mkdir -p custom
touch custom/custom.css
code custom/custom.css
```
Edit `custom.css` with:

```css
summary {
    cursor: pointer;
    display:list-item;
}
summary::marker {
    font-size: 1em;
}
```

You can close VS Code.

### `jupyter` check up

Let's reset your terminal:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Now, check you can launch a notebook server on your machine:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser should open on a `jupyter` window:

![jupyter.png](images/jupyter.png)

Click on `New`:

![jupyter_new.png](images/jupyter_new.png)

A tab should open on a new notebook:

![jupyter_notebook.png](images/jupyter_notebook.png)

### `nbextensions` check up

Perform a sanity check for `jupyter notebooks nbextensions`. Click on `Nbextensions`:

![jupyter_nbextensions.png](images/jupyter_nbextensions.png)

Untick _"disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility"_ then check that _at least_ all `nbextensions` circled in red are enabled:

![nbextensions.png](images/nbextensions.png)

You can close your web browser then terminate the jupyter server with `CTRL` + `C`.


### Python setup check up

Check your Python version with the following commands:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/python_checker.sh)" 3.8.12
```

Run the following command to check if you successfully installed the required packages:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.sh)"
```

Now run the following command to check if you can load these packages:
```bash
python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.py)"
```

Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

And open a `Python 3` notebook.

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run :
``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.



## DBeaver

Download and install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), a free and open source powerful tool to connect to any database, explore the schema and even **run SQL queries**.


## Docker 🐋

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

_if you already have Docker installed on your machine please update with the latest version_

### Install Docker

Go to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) website and choose your operating system:

![](images/docker.png)

Then follow the setup instructions, you are going to install a desktop application.

Once done and launched, check Docker is up and running:

```bash
docker info
```

You should get:

![](images/docker_info.png)



## Slack (optional)

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communcation platform pretty popular in the tech industry.

### Installation

[Download the Slack app](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) and install it.

:warning: If you are already using Slack in your browser, please download and install **the desktop app** which is fully featured.


### Settings

Launch the app and sign in to `lewagon-alumni` organization.

Make sure you **upload a profile picture** :point_down:

![How to upload a profile picture on Slack](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/slack_profile_picture.gif)

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

To ensure that everything is working fine for video calls, let's test your camera and microphone:
- Open the Slack app
- In any channel message bar type `/call --test` and press `Enter`
- Click on the "Start test" green button

![Check microphone and webcam with Slack](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/slack_call_test.png)

:heavy_check_mark: When the test is finished, you should see green "Succeed" messages at least for your microphone and camera. :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.

You can also install Slack app on your phone and sign in `lewagon-alumni`!
